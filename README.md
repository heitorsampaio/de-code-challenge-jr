## Let's get started ðŸš€

Frist you need to clone this repo, open your terminal and type:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/heitorsampaio/de-code-challenge-jr.git && cd de-code-challenge-jr
```

Now certify that you are inside the project folder:
```bash
$ ls

.
+-- /data
|   +-- category.txt
|   +-- jobs.txt
+-- docker-compose.yml
+-- Dockerfile
+-- main.ipynb
+-- main.py
+-- README.md
+-- requirements.txt
```

Now we can build the project:
```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

You can run the solutions in two ways, first:
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```
**or**
```
$ jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```
